# Balanced Binary Search Tree in JavaScript

Part of The Odin Project assignments

## Following functions are available to the `Tree` Class

- `buildTree` takes an array of data and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed

- `insert` inserts node into tree

- `delete` deletes node from tree

- `find` returns the node with the given value if it exists in the tree

- `levelOrder` performs breadth first traversal on the tree and accepts a callback to be called on each node, if no callback passed returns an array with all nodes in the tree

- `inorder`, `preorder`, and `postorder` performs depth first traversals on the tree and accepts a callback to be called on each node, if no callback passed returns an array with all nodes in the tree

- `height` accepts a node and returns its height, longest path from the node.

- `depth` accepts a node and returns its depth, how deep the node is from root node.

- `isBalanced` checks if the tree is balanced.

- `rebalance` rebalances an unbalanced tree.
